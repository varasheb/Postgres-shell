>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Transaction Control Language (TCL)<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Transaction Control Language (TCL) in SQL is used to manage transactions in a database. 
It allows you to control and ensure the integrity of the data within transactions. 

The main TCL commands are:

BEGIN (or START TRANSACTION):
Starts a new transaction.

BEGIN;
-- or
START TRANSACTION;


COMMIT:
Saves all the changes made during the current transaction.
COMMIT;


ROLLBACK:
Undoes all the changes made during the current transaction, reverting the database to its previous state.
ROLLBACK;


SAVEPOINT:
Sets a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back.
SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;


ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT:
Rolls back the transaction to the specified savepoint.
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;


RELEASE SAVEPOINT:
Removes a savepoint, making it no longer available for rollback.
RELEASE SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;

Example 

-- Start a transaction
BEGIN;

INSERT INTO student (first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, email, course_id)
VALUES ('Alice', 'Johnson', '1995-04-12', 'alice.johnson@example.com', 102);

UPDATE student
SET email = 'updated.email@example.com'
WHERE student_id = 3;

SAVEPOINT before_delete;

DELETE FROM student WHERE student_id = 5;

ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT before_delete;

COMMIT;
