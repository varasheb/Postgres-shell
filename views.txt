>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Views <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
views in PostgreSQL are virtual tables that represent the result of a stored query. They provide a way to simplify complex queries,
encapsulate logic, and improve security by restricting access to specific data.

** Types of Views

Simple View: A view based on a single table.
Complex View: A view based on multiple tables with joins and/or aggregations.
Materialized View: A view that stores its result set as a physical table, which can be refreshed periodically.

syntax

CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
