>>>>> Index <<<<<<<<<<

An index in a database is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table at the cost
of additional storage space and maintenance overhead. Indexes are used to quickly locate and access the data in a
database table without having to scan every row.
----------syntax---------
CREATE [UNIQUE] INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column_name [ASC|DESC] [, ...])

Examples

CREATE INDEX idx_student_email ON student(email);
