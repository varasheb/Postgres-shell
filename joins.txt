INNER JOIN: Returns rows when there is at least one match in both tables.
---->
SELECT student.student_id, student.first_name, student.last_name, course.course_name
FROM student
INNER JOIN course ON student.course_id = course.course_id;


LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the left table (student), and the matched rows from the right table (course). The result is NULL from the right side if there is no match.
--->
SELECT student.student_id, student.first_name, student.last_name, course.course_name
FROM student
LEFT JOIN course ON student.course_id = course.course_id;


RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the right table (course), and the matched rows from the left table (student). The result is NULL from the left side when there is no match.
-------->
SELECT student.student_id, student.first_name, student.last_name, course.course_name
FROM student
RIGHT JOIN course ON student.course_id = course.course_id;


FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN): Returns rows when there is a match in one of the tables. It essentially combines the results of both LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN.
----->
SELECT student.student_id, student.first_name, student.last_name, course.course_name
FROM student
FULL JOIN course ON student.course_id = course.course_id;


CROSS JOIN: Returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, i.e., all possible combinations of rows.
------>
SELECT student.student_id, student.first_name, student.last_name, course.course_name
FROM student
CROSS JOIN course;
